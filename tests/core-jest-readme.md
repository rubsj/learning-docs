-Learnings from JEST

    - to e able to navigate to its source code and get intellisense for it install @types/jest
    - Jest will treat any file that ends in .test.js or .spec.js as a test file. 
    - Jest will also consider files that are in a __TESTS__ folder to be test files, if you want to keep your tests separate.
